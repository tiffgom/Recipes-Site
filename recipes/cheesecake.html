    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham 
        cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.</p>

    <p>The classic cheesecake is creamy, silky, and smooth. It’s thick, it’s velvety, and there’s no denying its decadence. 
        While there’s a glaring absence of chunks, swirls, and sprinkles in this ivory crowned jewel, there’s nothing plain about this cheesecake!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Block cream cheese</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Pre-made Graham cracker crust</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Unsweetened ccocoa powder</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>It’s important that your cream cheese comes to room temperature before you begin making your cheesecake. This will prevent any lumps and ensure a cheesecake with a smooth, creamy texture. However, to ensure that all of your ingredients blend together nicely and give you the desired result, they should all be at room temperature before you begin.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air). </li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
